Automatic RFI Detection Algorithms
==================================

Currently only one automatic algorithm for RFI detection is implemented.




Simple Threshold Algorithm
===========================

Method: sigma-clipping.

Parameters: number of r.m.s. above the median data value.

The user defines the flagging threshold as a multiple of the data r.m.s. To help
in this choice, the mean, median and r.m.s. for each data type (L, R, Q, U) are displayed.
The user may chose to apply the flagging to one or more data types. In case more data
types are to be flagged simultaneously, the proper threshold for each type is computed
wit the related r.m.s.
The algorithm identifies all the data above the threshold, creating a number of rectangular
regions defining the flagged areas. These regions are displayed on the image and listed as
a single item in the item list.
