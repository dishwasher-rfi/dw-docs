Data formats
============

Currently the supported data format is:

* *fits*: the Flexible Image Transport System 

Limited features for *hdf5* (the Hierarchical Data Format 5) support have been included but
currenlty they are not working for data flagging.

fits
^^^^
DW support the *fits* file format with the specifications defined for the 
Italian radio telescopes, see

hdf5
^^^^
DW does not have a complete support for the *hdf5*.

It was implemented in the fists stages of the developement for testing purpouses for the *roach board* custom output. In the future, if a standard will be defined, the support will be completed.
