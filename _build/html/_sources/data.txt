============

Currently there are two supported data formats:

* *fits*: the Flexible Image Transport System 

* *hdf5*: the Hierarchical Data Format 5 

fits
^^^^
DW support the *fits* file format with the specifications defined for the Sardinian Radio Telescope (SRT) in the file:

`SRT-MAN-10000-003-3.pdf`_

This is the primary input data format.

hdf5
^^^^
DW does not have a complete support for the *hdf5*.

It was implemented in the fists stages of the developement for testing purpouses for the *roach board* custom output. In the future, if a standard will be defined, the support will be completed.
