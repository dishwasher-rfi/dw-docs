Flag table
==========

An entry in the flag table has the folowing elements:

* *nop:* Rappresent the id of the flag operation.
* *algorithm:* The algorithm used for the flag. If is a manual flag the value is "Manual"
* *params:* The parameters of the used algorithm. If algorithm is "Manual" is *None*.
* *flagresult:* The label produced by the algorithm. If algorithm is "Manual" is *None*.
* *flag_data:* Contain an array of four elements expressing a flagged rectangular area (y_min, y_max, x_min, x_max).
* *section:* The name of the table of the section to which the flag refers.
* *pola:* The polarization to which the flag refers.

A flagging set is defined by the *nop* number. 

If an algorithm produce irregulars shapes, they are divided in rectangles and saved whit the same *nop* number.
DW reconstruct a flagging matrix from the *flag_data* values of a given *nop*.
